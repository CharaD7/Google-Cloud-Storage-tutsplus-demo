### Tuts+ Tutorial: Google Cloud Storage: Managing buckets and objects

#### Instructor: Shalabh Aggarwal

Google Cloud Storage(GCS) is a very simple and powerful object storage offering from Google as a part of its Google Cloud Platform(GCP). It provides a highly durable, scalable, consistent and available storage solution to the developers and is the same technology that Google uses to power its own object storage. In this tutorial series, I cover how to manage buckets and objects (files and folders) on Google Cloud Storage.
